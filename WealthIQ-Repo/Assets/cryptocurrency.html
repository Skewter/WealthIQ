            <h2>1. Bitcoin</h2>
            <p>
                Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.

            <h2>2. Ethereum</h2>
            <p>
                Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, fraud or third-party interference. These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property.

            <h2>3. Litecoin</h2>
            <p>
                Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive Scrypt proof of work mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.

                XRP is a digital currency developed by Ripple Labs Inc. It's used for fast and low-cost international money transfers, especially for banks and financial institutions.

            <p>
                Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was initially started as a joke but has since gained a large following and community. It features the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and is known for its friendly and lighthearted community. Despite its origins, Dogecoin has gained value and is used for tipping and charitable donations.

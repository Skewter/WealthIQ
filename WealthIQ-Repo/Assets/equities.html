            <h2>1. What are Equities?</h2>
            <p>
                Equities, also known as stocks or shares, represent ownership in a company. When you buy equities, you become a shareholder and have a claim on the company's assets and earnings. Equities are traded on stock exchanges, and their prices fluctuate based on supply and demand.

            <h2>2. How to Invest in Equities</h2>
            <p>
                Investing in equities can be done through brokerage accounts, where you can buy and sell stocks. It's essential to research companies, understand their financials, and consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before investing.

            <h2>3. Why Equities?</h2>
            <p>
                Equities offer the potential for high returns over the long term. They provide an opportunity to participate in the growth of companies and economies. Additionally, dividends from equities can provide a steady income stream.

            <h2>4. Normal Equities vs. Dividend Equities</h2>
            <p>
                Normal equities focus on capital appreciation, where investors aim to profit from increases in the stock price. Dividend equities, on the other hand, prioritize regular dividend payments, providing investors with income in addition to potential capital gains.
